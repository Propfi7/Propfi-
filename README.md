🏗️ PropFi — Tokenized Real Estate on XRPL & Hedera

Own it. Trade it. Earn from it. That’s the PropFi way. 🌍

📖 Overview

PropFi is a multi-chain real estate tokenization platform built on the XRP Ledger and Hedera Hashgraph.
It allows users to fractionally own, trade, and stake tokenized properties while earning passive income from verified rental profits.

Using Hedera’s Token Service (HTS) and XRPL’s native tokenization layer, PropFi bridges blockchain and real estate to create transparent, liquid, and inclusive property investment opportunities.
