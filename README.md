🏡 PropFi – Tokenizing Real Estate on XRP Ledger & Hedera Hashgraph
PropFi is a blockchain-based platform that enables tokenization of real estate properties, allowing users to own, trade, and earn from fractional shares of real estate assets. By leveraging Hedera Hashgraph’s speed, low-cost transactions, and energy efficiency, PropFi brings transparency, liquidity, and inclusiveness to the real estate industry.
Traditional real estate investment often requires large capital and complex documentation. PropFi removes these barriers by turning properties into digital tokens, each representing a verified share of ownership. These tokens can be bought, sold, or staked directly on the platform, giving users the opportunity to earn passive income through rental profits or value appreciation
💡 Vision
To democratize real estate ownership by creating a world where anyone — regardless of location or income — can invest, trade, and earn from global properties with ease and transparency through blockchain technology.
🎯 Mission
PropFi’s mission is to revolutionize real estate investment by:

💼 Use Case Example
Imagine a property in Lagos worth $100,000. PropFi tokenizes it into 100,000 tokens (each worth $1).
Anyone can invest by buying tokens, and when the property generates rental income, profits are automatically distributed to token holders. Investors can later sell or trade their tokens anytime, bringing liquidity to an otherwise illiquid asset.
